# Security
Spring Securityâ€™s InMemoryUserDetailsManager implements UserDetailsService to provide support for username/password based authentication that is stored in memory. InMemoryUserDetailsManager provides management of UserDetails by implementing the UserDetailsManager interface. UserDetails-based authentication is used by Spring Security when it is configured to accept a username and password for authentication.
